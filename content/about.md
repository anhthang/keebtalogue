**Keebtalogue** is a project made for artisan keycap and keyboard enthusiasts.

It's inspired from [KeycapLendar](https://keycaplendar.firebaseapp.com/) and [Keycap Archivist](https://keycap-archivist.com)
which I want to have full managed of the database instead of uploading to Google Docs file.
And I want to have a catalogue of all keyboard related things available here (keyboard, keycap set, artisan keycap...)
